Features I tried to Incorporate:
- Practice with state management with redux, same as above
- Using the TMBD API to pull movies for the Netflix courosel.
- Depolyed using firebase hosting

Issues I Faced: 
- I wanted to use stripe but firebase requires you to set up a subscription and I didnt want to do that. Otherwise I wouldâ€™ve just followed the documentationt to implement that
